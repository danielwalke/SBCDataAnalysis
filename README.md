## 1. Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently revolutionizing countless domains in our
daily lives. In many domains like medicine data required for building AI is interconnected (e.g., sequential
measurements). However, current AI algorithms cannot utilize connections between data which limits their
learning capabilities. A promising technology for exploiting those connections is Graph Neural Networks. In
this study, we evaluated when Graph Neural Networks represent a valuable alternative to current AI algorithms
and what limitations this new technology has exemplified on the classification of blood measurements
as septic or not. Finally, we reveal the underlying mechanisms of Graph Neural Networks and current AI
approaches for the prediction.
